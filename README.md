# Implementation-of-OR-Gate-on-Zynq-7000-
A digital logic design in VHDL that simulates and implements an OR gate on an FPGA. The output is high ('1') when at least one of the inputs is high. This project was created to practice basic combinational logic design and gain hands-on experience with the FPGA development process.
